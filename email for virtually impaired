The Voice-Based Email System for visually impaired users is designed to provide an accessible way to send, receive, and manage emails using voice commands. The project employs Java for backend logic, Google Speech-to-Text API for converting speech into text, and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology to read emails aloud. Natural Language Processing (NLP) enhances command recognition and improves interaction accuracy. A user-friendly interface built with Swing or JavaFX ensures accessibility and ease of navigation.
